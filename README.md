# Description
This is a very basic project written in vanilla PHP (v8.3). It is meant to be an imaginary gym management system, containing employee, member and product data.
Employees can enter a purchase of a product made by a member in the system.
All the purchases can be seen in a separate page which includes pagination.
Currently every user/employee can register new employees, members and products. This is meant to be changed in the future.
The project uses Bootstrap v5.0 for the front-end.

## Usage
Run this project with `php -S localhost:8000` (or whichever port you prefer).

## Credentials
Use the `admin:admin` as username:password to log in to the system.
